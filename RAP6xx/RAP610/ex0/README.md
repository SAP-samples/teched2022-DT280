### Find/Replace

In the course of these exercises you will frequently see the task to "_replace the placeholder **`###`** with your group ID_". For this it's recommended to make use of the **Find/Replace** feature of the Eclipse Editor. It can be opened either via the menu (**_Edit -> Find/Replace..._**) or via **Ctrl+F**.
  
   ![find and replace](images/find01.png)
   
   Choosing **Replace All** allows you to replace all ocurrences of **`###`** with your group ID.
   
### Modern ABAP Syntax

The modern, declarative, and expression-oriented ABAP language syntax will be used in the different exercises. It allows developers to write more simple and concise source code using new language features like inline declarations, constructor expressions.
